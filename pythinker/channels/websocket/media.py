"""Image MIME sniffing and upload limits for the WebSocket channel.

The decode/persist routine for inbound base64 image envelopes lives on
:class:`pythinker.channels.websocket.channel.WebSocketChannel` as
``_save_envelope_media`` to keep its tight coupling to the channel's
configured media root (see ``get_media_dir``).
